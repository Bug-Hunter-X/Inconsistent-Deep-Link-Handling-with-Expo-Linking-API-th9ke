To improve the reliability of deep link handling, utilize the following strategy:

1. **Check for initial URL on app mount:**
```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleInitialUrl = async () => {
      const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
      setInitialUrl(url);
    };
    handleInitialUrl();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialUrl) {
      // Handle the initial URL
      console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl);
    }
  }, [initialUrl]);

  // ... rest of your app
}
```
2. **Improved Event Listener:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
      // Handle the URL
      console.log('Deep link received:', event.url);
    });

    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);
```
By combining these methods, you will have a more robust system that handles both initial URLs and subsequent deep links reliably, even if the application was restarted or was backgrounded.
