This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Expo's Linking API where deep link event listeners may not reliably trigger after an app restart or when the app is in the background. The `LinkingBug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior, while `LinkingSolution.js` provides a solution using a combination of techniques including checking for initial URLs on app startup and employing more robust event handling.
